# gherlint
Linter for Gherkin feature files, written in Python

## Install
Simply run ``pip install gherlint``.

## Linting Feature Files
``gherlint`` comes with a command line interface.
To recursively lint all feature files in a directory, run ``gherlint lint <path>``.

## Computing Metrics
``gherlint`` can also create some metrics for you if you want to know how many features, scenarios and steps you have
in your test suite. To do so, run ``gherlint stats <path>``.

## Disclaimer
``gherlint`` is still in an early development phase. New checks will be added over time.
If you want to contribute, feel free to open issues suggesting useful checkers, or open a pull request if you want to!

The following work items are planned for the upcoming releases:

* V0.0.x - V0.1.0:
    * Parser and object model for feature files
